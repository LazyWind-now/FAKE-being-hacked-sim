FAKE HACK SIMULATOR
by Lazy Wind

────────────────────────────────────

WHAT IS THIS?

This is a scripted VISUAL HACKING SIMULATION for Windows.
It is designed to look like a full system breach and escalation sequence.

Nothing shown is real.
The effects are intentional.

────────────────────────────────────

PLATFORM

• WINDOWS ONLY
• Built for Windows Command Prompt (.bat)
• Not compatible with macOS or Linux

────────────────────────────────────

WHAT IT DOES

• Displays fake security alerts and system logs
• Runs a real-time countdown with a progress bar
• Shows escalating warning messages and popups
• Enters a final panic loop
• ALWAYS shuts down the computer at the end

Once started, the sequence is meant to complete.

────────────────────────────────────

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO

• No real hacking
• No data theft
• No internet access
• No malware installation
• No persistence after shutdown

This is a simulation with dramatic effects only.

IMPORTANT USE NOTICE

This program is INTENTIONALLY disruptive.

Run it ONLY:
• On your own computer
• Or on a system where shutdown is acceptable
• With full permission from the owner

Do NOT use this to threaten, harass, or deceive people into thinking they are actually compromised.

HOW TO STOP IT

• You generally cannot stop it once it has started
• Closing the window or pressing CTRL + C may NOT prevent shutdown
• The safest way to stop it is to NOT run it

Advanced users may edit the file beforehand to remove or comment out the shutdown command.
