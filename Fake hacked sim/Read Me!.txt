# FAKE-being-hacked-sim

WARNING — DO NOT RUN ANY SCRIPTS FROM THIS REPOSITORY ON A MACHINE YOU CARE ABOUT.

This repository is a demonstration/simulation created by lazyWind that shows how a "being hacked" scenario could be simulated by initiating a system shutdown. It is intended for educational and testing purposes only.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate a simulated shutdown trigger for education, demos, or testing.
- Provide a safe example to inspect how a shutdown command might be invoked by code.

## Important: What this project DOES
- If executed, one or more scripts in this repository are designed to initiate a system shutdown or power-off on the host machine.
- Running those scripts will cause the machine to power off, which can interrupt work and may lead to loss of unsaved data.

## Important: What this project DOES NOT
- This repository is a simulation and is not intended to copy, exfiltrate, modify, or transmit your personal files or data.
- There is no included code whose purpose is to collect, send, or steal data from your machine. However, you must still exercise caution — do not run anything here on systems that contain important data.

## Safety recommendations
- Do not run any files from this repository on production machines, primary devices, or any machine with important data.
- To inspect or test the contents safely, use an isolated, disposable environment such as a virtual machine (VM), container, or sandbox with no network access and no valuable data.
- Prefer static inspection (open files in a text editor), code review, and automated static analysis tools before running anything.
- Back up any important data before experimenting in environments that are not disposable.

## Affected systems
- Shutdown behavior may affect Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms depending on the script. Do not assume any platform is safe.

## Creator
- Created by lazyWind (GitHub: LazyWind-now).

## Questions or concerns
If you're unsure about a file or what it does, open an issue or ask before running anything. If you want a safer, commented walkthrough of specific files, request it and inspect them only in a disposable environment.
